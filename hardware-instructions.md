# Instructions

## Prepare the shelf
Use the hole saw to create an opening for the speaker. For more stable mount use the 64mm drill, although it makes it a little hard to install the hardware on the inside.
Make sure to put the holw on the _bottom_ of the shelf, it is very easy to get confused here. Also don't drill to deep or you'll damage the top of shelf.
